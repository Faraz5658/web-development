                <p>
                    Sajji (Balochi and Urdu: سجی) is a Balochi dish originating from the Balochistan province of
                    Pakistan.[1][2]

                    Traditional and authentic sajji consists of lamb, marinated only in salt with a few spices.
                    Sajji is
                    considered done when it is at the 'rare' stage. It is served with rice that is cooked inside the
                    animal, which is baked in an oven, wrapped around a stone "tandoor". Regional varieties are
                    found
                    with subtle differences in flavouring. Notably, in the urban centres of Karachi, Islamabad or
                    Lahore, chicken is used instead of lamb, the sajji is roasted until it is medium or well-done
                    and is
                    served with rice instead of Balochistan's traditional Kaak bread
